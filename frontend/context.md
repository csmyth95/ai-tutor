# Frontend Context
## App Pages
### Landing Page
Gives short but descriptive information of MuinteoirAI. When a user lands on this page, they should be presented with the title, the
description of the app, a button to allow a user to upload their first PDF document or to login to their account. This page needs
to be simple, to the point, eye catching and easily digestible.

### Registration
Should be another simple page. Ask user to input their minimum details required to create a page.
The details: email, password, first name, last name. After inputting their details, the user should be sent an email with a 1 time verification code
& if the code is successfully entered, they should be presented with a login page.

### Login
The user should be presented with the app logo and a short form to enter their email and password.
If a user forgets their password, they should be able to click a button to reset their password using their email.

### Quiz Question
Create a page for a generic Quiz page including a progress bar, current question number, the question itself and a form for the user to answer the question.

### Admin Dashboard
A simple dashboard to show KPIs of the app including number of registered users, number of documents uploaded, summarisation success rate,
number of quizzes created and over time more information to inform the enhancement of the app.
